I am a computer science professional with a strong foundation in engineering, software development, and data analysis, recently earning my Engineer-in-Training (EIT) certification. I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from UC San Diego and currently serve as a Patent Examiner in Computer Science at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. My experience spans data analytics, IT support, and engineering design, where I have applied skills in Python, C++, Java, SQL, JavaScript, and frameworks such as NumPy, Sklearn, and Node.js. Proactive and detail-oriented, I thrive on solving complex problems and leveraging technology to drive innovation and efficiency.
