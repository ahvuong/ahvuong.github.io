Heading a collaborative development project, a robust web application is under construction to facilitate extensive data maintenance and querying requirements. This application utilizes an efficiently designed E/R schema, validated to accurately model all data relationships and attributes, while employing JSP, HTML, and CSS to create a responsive administration interface for streamlined data entry. Additionally, SQL scripts, including stored procedures and parameterized Java and JSP queries, have been integrated with Apache Tomcat for customizable reporting, optimizing CRUD operations and incorporating decision queries and triggers driven by parameters using PostgreSQL.
