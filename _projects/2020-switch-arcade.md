A team of five members came together to design the Python-based Switch Arcade Game. Six mini arcade games were meticulously built, each featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and unique features. The graphical user interface (GUI) in these games was enriched by tapping into the capabilities of Python libraries like Turtle and Tkinter, resulting in an immersive gaming experience that showcased the power of Python for game development.
