* Designed and implemented a Verilog-based state machine to control a four-way traffic system, applying logic design, FPGA-style development, and digital circuit modeling to manage timing, sequencing, and safe operations.
* Built and validated the system using simulation tools and test benches, performing waveform analysis to verify signal transitions and reliability, demonstrating skills in digital design, testing methodologies, and hardware verification.*/
