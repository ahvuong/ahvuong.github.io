Shadow mapping is a technique used to enhance the realism and depth perception in 3D scenes by adding shadows. It involves creating shadows in a scene by determining the depth of objects from a light source's perspective during the rendering process. The implementation of this lighting technique and code structure is rooted in C++ and is built upon the foundational structure of the shadow map algorithm as provided by OpenGL tutorials. This project was a collaborative effort, completed by a team of two members.
